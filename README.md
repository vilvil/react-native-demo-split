# React Native Bundle Splitter

Split config: [splitconfig](./split-example/.splitconfig).

## Why just an EXAMPLE (not a complete library)

RN Bundle split is not just "split", it should also take two point into consideration:

- **How to use them**, means native code framework change, because RN native part not support loading script in demand.
- **Project structure**, you should have a clean project dependency graph (recursive dependency is bad).

So, I don't want to make it to a library which be common to use.

In this example, it have clear project structure and some hack to RN framework (by reflection in Java). All split-bundle related code is in **src** directory, use them with pleasure:)

## Project Structure

```
/root
 |- /src
   |- /components
     |- /packagea
       |- SampleA.js      => Entry1
       |- ApiOfSampleA.js => Refered in SampleA.js
     |- /packageb
       |- SampleB         => Entry2
       |- ApiOfSampleA.js => Refered in SampleA.js
   |- /modules
     |- index.js      => Append to base
     |- ModuleA.js    => Refered in index.js
     |- ModuleB.js    => Refered in index.js
 |- base.js          => Entry of base
 |- resolveInject.js => Resolve splitted resource
```

## Usage
path : ${project_dir}/split-example/
```

npm install
node ../index.js --platform android --output build --config .splitconfig --dev false

iOS:
npm install
node ../index.js --platform ios --output build/ios --config .splitconfig --dev false
```
